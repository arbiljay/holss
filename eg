  "description": "Set seven years before the events of the original 'Saint Seiya' manga, the story of 'Episode G' revolves around Leo Aiolia, who is mistrusted by his fellow Saints because of the seemingly traitorous past actions of his brother Sagittarius Aiolos. In turn, Aiolia holds a grudge against the Saints as a whole, and against the elite order of the Gold Saints in particular. While Aiolia is sent on mission after mission to prove his loyalty, a modern-day Titanomachy begins as the Titans, ancient gods with a desire for revenge on the Olympian gods, attack the earth.",
